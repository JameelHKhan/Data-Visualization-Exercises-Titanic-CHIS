# Data-Visualization-Exercises-Titanic-CHIS

These are two exploratory Data Visualization exercises via ggplot2 using the Titanic and 2009 California Health Interview Survey.  Both exercises were completed on DataCamp from the "Data Visualization with ggplot2" courses (part 1 and 2).

The titanic dataset's visualizations operate under the pretense of attempting to determing the viewer's chances of surviving the disaster based on age, sex, and passenger class.
